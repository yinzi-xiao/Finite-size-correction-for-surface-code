# Finite-size-correction-for-surface-code
The repository contains all data and code in paper &lt;Exact results on finite size corrections for surface codes tailored to biased noise>.

Repository structure:<br>
<toolbox.py>: python file which contains editted run function for analysing different error channels.<br>
<around_special_point>: folder which contains data for XZZX code when error rate is around the special point. <visualize_witherrorbar.py> is an example code to visualize the data.<br>
<failure_rate>: folder which contains data for XZZX code to study the change of failure rate with code distance under certain error rate. <visualize_[].py> are example codes to visualize the data.<br>
<special_point>: folder which contains data for XZZX code and XY code when error rate is at the special point. <visualize_[].py> are example codes to visualize the data.<br>
<threshold_trend>: folder which contains data for XZZX code at different code distances to study the threshold trend of different error channels. <treshold_trend.py> is a code to create txt files which contain the threshold at different code distances. <visualize.py> is an example code to visualize the threhsold trend.<br>
